1. Bandwidth and Latency
   Bandwidth(Throughput) is a measure of width of a frequency band, thus measure the amount of data transferred in a unit of time. 
   Latency (delay) is the amount of time it takes to go from one network to another network. 
   Latency = propagation + transmit + queue
   Propagation = Distance / Speed of Light
   Transmit = size/ bandwidth
   Propagation delay is the time it takes to push all data to travel from one end to another. 
   Transmit Delay is the amount of time it takes to push all the data to the other end, calculated by size / bandwidth
   Queuing Delay is the amount of time it takes when the data arrives earlier than expected, and needs to wait before being processed. 
3. Delay x Bandwidth Product
   If we think of the a channel between a pair of processes as a hollow pipe where the latency is the length of the pip and the bandwidth gives the diameter of the pipe then the delay x bandwidth product gives the volume of the pipe - the maximum number of bits that could be transmitted through the pip at any given instant. 
4. Application requirements
   Jitter is the variance in latency, measures the change and how much latency change over time. Components of delay: Prop Delay : wont change much, but based on distance. Transmit delay depends on changing bandwidth and queuing delay is due to congestion in the router
