1. Layering and Protocols
	1. Layering
	   It decomposes the problem of building a network into more manageable components, implementing several layers instead of monolith application.
	   It provides a more modular design that can be easily configurable and addable
	1. Protocol
	   The abstract objects that make up the layers of a network system are called protocols.
	   Each protocol defines two different interfaces:
	   1. It defines a service interface to the other objects on the same computer that want to use its communication services, which the defines the operations that local objects can perform on the protocol.
	   2. It defines the form and meaning of messages exchanged between protocol peers to implement the communication service.
